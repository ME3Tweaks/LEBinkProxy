MinHook library is used in this project in a modified, non-original form.

 - All public functions but MH_Initialize, MH_CreateHook, MH_EnableHook have been stripped off.
 - HDE code for x32 has been stripped off.
 - Number of changes were made to avoid false positives from MS Defender:
   - FindHookEntry and EnterSpinLock have been given some dummy arguments.
   - MH_Initialize has been given a nonsensical loop calling memcpy on a small buffer.
   - MH_CreateHook has had its argument order reversed.
